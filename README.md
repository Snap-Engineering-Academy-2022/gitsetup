# Add your files to Git + Make your first branch!


## ‚û°Ô∏è Adding Files to Your Own Git Repo
- Sign up for a GitHub account (free student account for extra perks)
- On Github.com, create a new repo
- Then in the terminal,  navigate to the folder that contains your current files. Once there, initiate your git repo:

```bash
git init
```

- To check your status of your repo at any point, use this:

```bash
git status
```

- To add one file you want to commit:

```bash
git add FILENAME
```

- To add all the files you want to commit at once:

```bash
git add .
"(only adds the files in the current folder)"

OR

git add -A
"(no matter where you are in the repo)"
```

- Now let's take the "screenshot"

```bash
git commit -m "add a message explaining what you did here"
```

- We're going to create a new branch called 'main'

```bash
git branch -M main
```

- Now let's tell our git repo on our local computer which github repo to push up to!

```bash
git remote add origin LINK_TO_YOUR_GITHUB_REPO
```

- Finally, let's push

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

- Git config in the terminal

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email your.email@example.com
```

- Make a new folder and copy over Day #1 files (.html, .css, .js)
- Stage and commit changes, with commit message
- Set upstream for new branch and push
    
    
    ‚úÖ **Check your understanding:** 
    
    - Can you explain add vs commit vs push in your own words?
    - What‚Äôs the difference between local and remote?
    - What is the difference between a branch on a shared repo vs your own repo?



## ‚û°Ô∏è Adding Files to Our Shared Class Repo

- Clone the existing class repo

[Snap-Engineering-Academy-2022/classwebsite](https://github.com/Snap-Engineering-Academy-2022/classwebsite)

```bash
git branch

git branch YOURBRANCHNAME

git checkout YOURBRANCHNAME
```

- Repos can have branches!
    - There‚Äôs a main branch (which should always be code that works)
    - `git checkout -b` allows you to make your own branch
- Add, commit, and push!
    - `git push -u origin branch_name` creates the remote branch (vs. `checkout -b`)


## üß† Extra Commands for Reference
- Some more nifty commands you might find handy

```bash
git commit --amend

"(use this to edit a commit!)"

git push -f

"(then use force push to the github)"
```

```bash
git diff

"(use this to see what has changed in your code!)"
```

```bash
git stash

"(use this to get rid of your current changes that are not committed,
 it'll return your code to the state of your previous commit)" 

git stash pop 

"(use this to get the changes that you stashed away earlier)"
```
